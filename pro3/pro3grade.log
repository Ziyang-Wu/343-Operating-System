TEST PASSED 681383545


test clone2 PASSED (6 of 6)
Description: clone and make an assignment to the argument passed in.  In the parent, verify that the value of the arg has changed.

Finished running test clone2

Start running test clone3
Description: open a file a new file.  Call clone and verify that the child thread can write to the file (because it got a copy of the open file descriptor). Then have the child thread open a new file and verify that the parent can't write to it.

TEST PASSED 681383545


test sbrk-race PASSED (6 of 6)
Description: Trying to find race conditions, but honestly I think this test does nothing.  It calls clone 30 times then calls sbrk(0) in the parent and the child thread, then calls join 30 times to wait for all the child threads.

Finished running test sbrk-race
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**********************************************************************
Start running test sbrk-size
Description: check that thread has same size as parent.

TEST PASSED 681383545


test ec-thread_create2 PASSED (2 of 2)
Description: In a loop, repeatedly call thread_create then thread_join.  There should be no memory leaks so the process size returned by sbrk should not approach USERTOP

Finished running test ec-thread_create2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**********************************************************************
Start running test ec-multi
Description: In a loop, call thread_create many times.  In each worker, calculate several fibonacci numbers by calling a helper function.

test ec-noexit PASSED (2 of 2)
Description: no exit call in thread, should trap at bogus address, OS will kill it and all will be well.

Description: race condition in CV? (must atomically release lock and sleep).  This probably needs to be done in a loop to really test the race condition.

test build PASSED (15 of 15)
build xv6 using make

test clone PASSED (7 of 7)
Description: clone and verify that address space is shared

test clone2 PASSED (6 of 6)
Description: clone and make an assignment to the argument passed in.  In the parent, verify that the value of the arg has changed.

test clone3 PASSED (6 of 6)
Description: open a file a new file.  Call clone and verify that the child thread can write to the file (because it got a copy of the open file descriptor). Then have the child thread open a new file and verify that the parent can't write to it.

test clone4 PASSED (6 of 6)
Description: If a thread spawns another thread, address space is shared amongst thread group

test clone-and-exit FAILED (0 of 6)
Description: Call clone to create a couple threads then exit the main thread.  Repeat this over and over.  We shouldn't run out of space in the ptable and we shouldn't run out of memory.
 Timelimit (20.0s) exceeded

test badclone PASSED (6 of 6)
Description: clone with non-page-aligned stack argument.  clone with stack less than 1 page.  In both cases, should return -1.

test stack PASSED (6 of 6)
Description: set up stack correctly (and without extra items)

test join PASSED (6 of 6)
Description: Call clone, have the worker thread modify a global variable, then call join and verify that the global variable has changed.

test join2 PASSED (6 of 6)
Description: Call clone, then call join on the parent process (should return -1), then call join on the child thread, which should wait for child thread to exit and return child's pid.

test join3 PASSED (6 of 6)
Description: Calling join on a forked child process pid should return -1 (join is only valid on threads, not processes).

test join4 PASSED (6 of 6)
Description: Calling wait on a process with child threads but no child processes should return -1.

test join5 FAILED (0 of 6)
Description: Call clone to create a new thread (thread1), which calls clone to create another new thread (thread2).  thread1 calls join on thread2.  main thread calls join on thread1.
 Timelimit (20.0s) exceeded

test sbrk-race PASSED (6 of 6)
Description: Trying to find race conditions, but honestly I think this test does nothing.  It calls clone 30 times then calls sbrk(0) in the parent and the child thread, then calls join 30 times to wait for all the child threads.

test sbrk-size PASSED (6 of 6)
Description: check that thread has same size as parent.

test ec-thread_create PASSED (2 of 2)
Description: Call thread_create. Have the worker check the argument passed in, modify a global variable, then exit. Call thread_join on the worker.

test ec-thread_create2 PASSED (2 of 2)
Description: In a loop, repeatedly call thread_create then thread_join.  There should be no memory leaks so the process size returned by sbrk should not approach USERTOP

test ec-multi PASSED (2 of 2)
Description: In a loop, call thread_create many times.  In each worker, calculate several fibonacci numbers by calling a helper function.

test ec-locks PASSED (2 of 2)
Description: In a loop, call thread_create many times.  In the worker, in a loop, get the lock, read a global and store as a temp, waste a little time, then set global = temp + 1, then release the lock. After all workers have been joined, global should have the correct value.

test ec-noexit PASSED (2 of 2)
Description: no exit call in thread, should trap at bogus address, OS will kill it and all will be well.

test ec-race PASSED (2 of 2)
Description: race condition in CV? (must atomically release lock and sleep).  This probably needs to be done in a loop to really test the race condition.

test ec-size FAILED (0 of 2)
Description: check that address space size is updated in threads
 tester failed

test ec-cond PASSED (2 of 2)
Description: test cv_wait and cv_signal, cannot leave cv_wait without lock

test ec-cond2 PASSED (2 of 2)
Description: test cv_wait and cv_signal, don't wakeup on wrong cv

test ec-cond3 PASSED (2 of 2)
Description: test cv_wait and cv_signal, signal, could broadcast

Passed 22 of 25 tests.
Overall 22 of 25
Points 106 of 120
